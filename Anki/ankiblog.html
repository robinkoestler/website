                                        <h3>A two year journey through the vast jungle of spaced repetition</h3>
                                    </header>

                                    <p> Frankly, I have been hanging around in the jungle for a way longer time, although only developing the rigor to actually get somewhere reasonable in the last two years.
                                    So, in this first-ever blog post of me, I will give it a shot of explaining of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeDf-1Wr-Ks">how I got here</a> and why it should be in the best interest of all curiosity-driven human beings to mimic me and other <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"> Ankanions</a> (at least to some extent).
                                    As I'm writing these first lines (and by the way, I'm already enjoying my personal freedom of expression), I'm kind of feeling like an artificial intelligence trying to figure out where to head, including initially failing miserably at it.
                                    So, as you may have already noticed, I like to wildly reference music & popular culture, so you can never be sure if a certain link will be actually something useful or, like in the last case, just a random thing.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>
                                        The backstory
                                    </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I distinctly remember that, in the tenth grade, I was (or rather my parents did) noticing a continuous and concerning decline in my grades in  English.
                                        Being finally able to think more out-of-the-box as an adolescent, I was not really interested in studying vocabulary the old-fashioned way, i.e. by desperately trying to cram all of the due vocab into my brain the days before the test, like so many of us did and still continue to do today.
                                        That's where I first stumbled upon <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en&gl=US">AnkiDroid</a>, which was nothing else than an application for spaced repetition, with which I already had some basic experience since my mother bought me a clunky program called <a href="https://www.phase-6.de/">Phase 6</a>, which was a desktop application with nearly no modifying allowed.
                                        Motivated by my own initiative, I started to use AnkiDroid almost every day (proof is my review heatmap, not my memory of course), typing in the lectorial vocab and waiting for its magic to happen.
                                        And it did. 
                                        I must have been so convinced that the year after, when I dropped the dreary Latin and replaced it with the sexy Spanish, I decided to excel at Spanish vocabulary by employing the newly found AnkiDroid strategy right off the bat.
                                        Finally being among the very good pupils in a language must have surely provided me with decent self-confidence and a laid-back (no stress before exams) feeling of being able to learn anything, if only I would be willing to put in the daily effort.
                                    </p>

                                    As a happy user, I pursued this way until the end of high school, where I can proudly say that I got very good grades in English and Spanish after all.
                                    Presumably content with these results, I began to study mathematics, where I wouldn't need any of this knowledge anymore (or so I thought), so I stopped using AnkiDroid, letting all the repetitions and the acquired knowledge fall into pitch-darkness.
                                    I was obviously making a mistake, but fair enough: I only viewed Anki as a tool, which served a purpose.
                                    </p>
                                
                                    <h4>
                                        The beginning
                                    </h4>
									Somewhere around <a href="https://youtu.be/Gs069dndIYk?si=dnH4bfuO0zZeE7ld&t=17"> the 21st night of September</a> 2021, while enjoying a trip to L.A., I was quickly figuring out that I would need to revisit my English skills.
									Because I was on a kind of musical journey at that time, I was listening to a lot of new and old music, and I was very curious about the lyrics.
									So, I created my first Anki deck in years, being about unknown words occurring in lyrics.
									And I was hooked again, since it was entirely fun and I certainly was getting a gratification moment every time after understanding all of the words of a whole song intuitively.
									I still continue to expand this precise deck today.
									<p></p>
									<h4>
										Adding another deck
									</h4>
									
									Three months later, I was picking up on Spanish again because there has been a major change in my life, which was motivating me to do so.
									Moreover, the Spanish-German deck from <a href="https://www.spanisch-5000.de/index.htm#">spanisch-5000.de</a> I hooked up with was so elaborated, and I was especially impressed by the quality as well as how detailed and well-thought-out it was.
									The deck consists of the 5000 most frequent Spanish words (sorted by frequency), and thus contains 10000 cards and another 5000 additional cards, which are utilized for learning about sayings, common real-life situations and showcasing the learnt vocab in general.
									Due to the fact that there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q5VMP84Bo4">so much things to say</a>: more about Spanish 5000 here (later).
									<p></p>
									
									After only a short time, I was committed to completing this challenge, although I knew that with twenty new cards a day, it would mean to learning daily for more than two years.
									But I was determined to do so, and I did.
									After about three months in, I was reaching my low point in many senses.
									I hadn't had yet registered any audible progress in my oral Spanish skills, yet my workload incremented every day.
									Besides, I was realizing that I would also have to learn conjugation the hard way (this was really the only grammar thing, which you could not already implicitly learn from S5000, which is already impressive on its own).								
									But then, all of a sudden my capabilities went skyrocketing, and I really felt like I was transcending swiftly through the early game of Spanish (A1-B1) by my incremental progress. 
									And this was mainly due to the constant "writing new information onto my personal harddisk, on my long term memory in my brain", who would have thought.
							
									<p></p>
									<h4>
										The inevitable to-do: training conjugation
									</h4>
									<p>
									First I thought that this was going to be a pain in the ass, recalling about all the weird ways of how we used singing as a method to remember the conjugation table in a school book.
									But then I found a treasure in the link database of S5000 (or among the shared decks on Anki), called <a href="https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.html">Ultimate Spanish Conjugation</a>.
									This is by far the best way to learn all (irregular) conjugation of a language, and I can say that with myself not having any linguistical university education, because I can compare it to these miserable attempts of learning conjugation in school.
									</p>
									<h4>
										Halfway through: vacations in Cuba
									</h4>
									<p>
										At some point you will find that you have learnt so much that you feel the insuppressable desire to go out into the world and talk, talk, talk.
										So, during my vacation in Havanna I was realizing that I had serious issues of understanding Spanish, if it's not presented to me in an official way, and that regards especially the pronunciation.
										The Cubans like to ignore the letter "s" in the end of a syllable, so I was having a hard time grabbing context words like "después".
										But I managed to get better at that, and I was also able to talk to the locals, which was a very nice experience.
										Furthermore, for the first time of my life I had the feeling that I was not lacking any essential words, which was a very nice feeling and useful in multiple situations.
										<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=579520937&sxsrf=AM9HkKmowtj6ID5k6Od0SUovat2kQmWdTg:1699141369163&q=obama+giving+medal+to+obama&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihsu3twquCAxWAgP0HHXbQBmUQ0pQJegQIDBAB&biw=1440&bih=787&dpr=2">This, I think, is directly attributable to the frequency-based approach.</a>
									</p>
									<h4>
										Adding another language: Portuguese
									</h4>
									<p>
										I already loved Portuguese before I haven't even learned to love Portuguese.
										When I met my lovely girlfriend from Rio de Janeiro, I was immediately hooked by how nice Portuguese sounded, and I thought, after having reached a certain level in Spanish, that it would be a good idea to pair 'em up during learning flashcards. For multiple reasons, of course. First, it's similar, thus a second one is easier. Second, the whole package is more than the sum of its parts.
										Third, I would have plenty of free practice, when I would be with my girlfriend.
										And fourth, I would be able to understand the lyrics of my favorite Brazilian songs.
