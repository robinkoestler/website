                                        <h3>A two year journey through the vast jungle of spaced repetition</h3>
                                    </header>

                                    <p> Frankly, I have been hanging around in the jungle for a way longer time, although only developing the rigorosity to actually get somewhere reasonable in the last two years.
                                    So, in this first-ever blog post of me, I will give it a shot of explaining of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeDf-1Wr-Ks">how I got here</a> and why it should be in the best interest of all curiosity-driven human beings to mimic me (at least to some extent).
                                    As I'm writing these first lines (and by the way, I'm already enjoying my personal freedom of expression), I'm kind of feeling like an artificial intelligence trying to figure out where to head, including initially failing miserably at it.
                                    So, as you may have already noticed, I like to wildly reference music & popular culture, so you can never be sure if a certain link will be actually something useful or, like in the last case, just a random thing.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>
                                        The backstory
                                    </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I distinctly remember that, in the 10th grade, I was (or rather my parents did) noticing a continuous and concerning decline in my grades in  English.
                                        Being finally able to think more out-of-the-box as an adolescent, I was not really interested in studying vocabulary the old-fashioned way, i.e. by desperately trying to cram all of the due vocab into my brain the days before the test, like so many of us did and still continue to do today.
                                        That's where I first stumbled upon <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en&gl=US">AnkiDroid</a>, which was nothing else than an application for spaced repetition, with which I already had some basic experience since my mother bought me a clunky program called <a href="https://www.phase-6.de/">Phase 6</a>, which was a desktop application with nearly no modifying allowed.
                                        Motivated by my own initiative, I started to use AnkiDroid almost every day (proof is my review heatmap, not my memory of course), typing in the lectorial vocab and waiting for its magic to happen.
                                        And it did. 
                                        I must have been so convinced that the year after, when I dropped the dreary Latin and replaced it with the sexy Spanish, I decided to excel at Spanish vocabulary by employing the newly found AnkiDroid strategy right off the bat.
                                        Finally being among the very good pupils in a language must have surely provided me with decent self-confidence and a laid-back (no stress before exams) feeling of being able to learn anything, if only I would be willing to put in the daily effort.
                                    </p>

                                    As a happy user, I pursued this way until the end of high school, where I can proudly say that I got very good grades in English and Spanish after all.
                                    Afterwards, I began to study mathematics, where I wouldn't need any of this knowledge anymore (or so I thought), so I stopped using AnkiDroid, letting all the repetitions and the acquired knowledge fall into pitch-darkness.
                                    I was obviously making a mistake, but fair enough: I only viewed Anki as a tool, which served a purpose.
                                    </p>
                                
                                    <h4>
                                        The beginning
                                    </h4>
									Somewhere around the 21st night of September 2021, while enjoying a trip to L.A., I was quickly figuring out that I would need to revisit my English skills.
									Because I was on a kind of musical journey at that time, I was listening to a lot of new and old music, and I was very curious about the lyrics.
									So, I created my first Anki deck in years, being about unknown words occurring in lyrics.
									And I was hooked again, since it was entirely fun and I certainly was getting a gratification moment every time after understanding all of the words of a whole song intuitively.
									I still continue to expand this precise collection today.

									<h4>
										Adding another deck
									</h4>

									Three months later, I was picking up on Spanish again because there has been a major change in my life, which was motivating me to do so.
									Moreover, the Spanish-German deck from spanisch-5000.de was so elaborated, and I was very impressed by the quality as well as how detailed and well-thought-out it was.
									The deck consists of the 5000 most frequent Spanish words (sorted by frequency), and thus contains 10000 cards and another 5000 additional cards, which are utilized for learning about sayings, common real-life situations and showcasing the learnt vocab in general.
									More about Spanish 5000 here (later).
									
									After only a short time, I was committed to completing this challenge, although I knew that with 20 new cards a day, it would mean to learning daily for more than two years.
									But I was determined to do so, and I did.
									After about three months in, I was reaching my low point in many senses.
									I hadn't had yet registered any audible progress in my Spanish skills, yet my workload incremented every day.
									Besides, I was realizing that I would also have to learn conjugation the hard way(this was really the only grammar thing, which you could not already implicitly learn from S5000).								
									But then, all of a sudden my capabilities went skyrocketing, and I really felt like I was transcending swiftly through the early game of Spanish (A1-B1) by my incremental progress.
									
									<h4>
										The inevitable to-do: conjugation
									</h4>
